<h1>Pierre Menard</h1>

<p>A fictional character, perhaps drawn from Louis Menard (1822-1901). In an article by the
symbolist writer Rémy de Gourmont (which Borges probably read), Louis Menard is
described as a master of parody. He attempted to rewrite some of the lost Greek tragedies,
including Aeschylus' Prometheus bound, and, as a hoax, wrote a piece which he attributed to
Diderot. Like the fictional Pierre Menard, he indulged in anachronistic readings, thinking of
Shakespeare when reading Homer, linking Helen with Hamlet and imagining Desdemona at
Achilles' feet (see Emir Rodríguez Monegal, Jorge Luis Borges: a Literary Biography 123
and Daniel Balderston, Out of Context, 149-50).</p>
