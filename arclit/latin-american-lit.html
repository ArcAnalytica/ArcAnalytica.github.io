    <h1>Authors of Latin America</h1>
    <p>Jorge Luis Borges is by far one of the most important writers of Latin America. 
        One metric which can be used to gauge an author’s importance is to consider 
        how many books have been written about them.   How much has their work captivated 
        the attention of literary critics, and how much debate has it generated? Counting books, 
        however, is easier said than done.  A set of criteria need to be established for which 
        books to include in such a count. Thus, to gain a sense of Borges’s reputation, a 
        basic approach could be to count how many books in the Library of Congress—the largest 
        collection in the world—, contain him as the subject. The same could then be done for his peers. 
        Upon tallying the number of materials that are: a) penned about authors from Latin America, 
        and b) housed in the world’s biggest library, it emerges that Borges, with 962, 
        is the second-most-written-about author from the region, second only to José Martí, with 975.  
        As the graph below (Figure 1.1) depicts, after Martí and Borges, there is a sharp drop-off. 
        They are followed by the Nobel laureates Neruda (with 485) and García Márquez (with 445), 
        in third and fifth. The highest-ranking Brazilian, Machado de Assis, places between them in 
        fourth (with 453); Darío (with 422) and Sarmiento (with 413) are next in sixth and seventh, respectively. </p>
