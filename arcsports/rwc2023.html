  <h1>Three measures to predict who will win the Rugby World Cup 2023</h1>

  <p>In this article we will analyze three factors regarding the top ten ranked squads for the Rugby World Cup 2023 in France.</p>
  
  <h2>Age</h2>
  <p>The first measure we will look at is age. By taking an average age of all 33 members in the squad, which nation has a "young squad?" 
    Which has an "old squad?"</p>

  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <p>Experience, which will be measured here by the number of international caps is also an important factor.</p>
